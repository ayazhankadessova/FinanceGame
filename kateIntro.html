				Kate just got accepted into college, but knows nothing about managing
				her finances. She is working part-time at a local library for $15 per
				hour, working for 5 hours a week. After tax and deductions she takes
				home $250.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, her parents are providing her an allowance of $100 every
				month, plus sheâ€™s saving on rent by staying at home. Starbucks coffee at
				least 3 times is a must for Kate and eating out once a week.
				Occasionally, she will go out with friends and spend money on
				entertainment.
			</p>
			<p>
				Kate has played guitar her entire life and wanted to save up for a new
				electric guitar, with her own money, for her band performance in 2
				months. Help Kate figure out her current financial situation and
				determine if she will have enough in before her performance!
