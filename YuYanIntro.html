        Meet YuYan, a determined and hardworking freshman at Hong Kong Baptist
        University. With her birthday fast approaching, she has set her sights
        on a goal that many might consider lofty - a visit to the magical world
        of DisneyLand.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there's a catch - YuYan wants to pay for this trip on her own, and
        with her high expenses, she knows that this will require some serious
        financial discipline.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, YuYan has decided to embark on a journey of financial
        responsibility, as she learns the importance of good saving habits,
        budgeting, and distinguishing between her needs and wants. She has set
        herself a goal of saving 640 Hong Kong dollars, which is no easy feat,
        but with her determination and grit, she is up for the challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join YuYan on her journey as she discovers the importance of budgeting
        and managing her expenses, while also learning to distinguish between
        her needs and wants. With a newfound appreciation for financial
        responsibility, and her sights set on her dream destination, YuYan is
        ready to take charge of her finances and make her birthday wish come
        true.
