- GCAP3166: Financial Planning: a Pre-emptive Measure to Various Social Issues

## Inspiration
As students, we do not have a good understanding of personal finance which is important for the real world. After some research, we learned that this is an issue for many adults because of how finance is not taught enough in schools. 

To help students learn about personal finance, we turned it into a story game with different topics. Combining it with Kahoot and Google forms to keep track of leaders, the best ones will get prizes!

## What it does

LEarnBU is a Story-based game but it's also a learning tool. Each story module is structured as a comprehensive learning tool for understanding the key concepts through video and reading material and testing their understanding through short quiz afterwards. Studeabout saving and spending, budgeting and the wise use of credit in preparation for game play. Select an age level of Rookie, Pro or Hall of Fame and download the modules.Make it a part of your classroom curriculum with these integral, engaging lesson modules.

The user can choose a story to play, each with a character that is dealing with a different aspect of personal finance: budgeting, retirement savings, investment, and joint finance. Each story will take the user through an educational story about how the character handles their financial situation with questions along the way.

## How we built it
Using HTML/CSS/JS in VS Code.
Google forms.
Kahoot.
## Challenges we ran into

There are different topics in personal finance that needs to be dealth and we decided to separate them into different stories. Moreover, we decided to add quizzer after every story to check understanding.
