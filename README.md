Financial Literacy Game
======
## Inspiration
As students, we do not have a good understanding of personal finance which is important for the real world. After some research, we learned that this is an issue for many adults because of how finance is not taught enough in schools. 

To help students learn about personal finance, we turned it into a story game with different topics. Combining it with Kahoot and Google forms to keep track of leaders, the best ones will get prizes!
## What it does
The user can choose a story to play, each with a character that is dealing with a different aspect of personal finance: budgeting, retirement savings, investment, and joint finance. Each story will take the user through an educational story about how the character handles their financial situation with questions along the way.
## How we built it
Using HTML/CSS/JS in VS Code and collaborating via Github.
Google forms.
Kahoot.
## Challenges we ran into

There are different topic in personal finance that needs to be dealth and we decided to separate them into different stories. Moreover, we decided to add quizzer after every story to check understanding.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of how well we were able to collaborate by having several meeting throughout the hackathon to brainstorm, design, and debug. We are also proud of how we designed our website so that it includes both the story and educational information and problems to allow the user to have fun while learning.
